The project tracks the building of DevSecOps agents

I'll help design a detailed framework for the Code Security Analysis Agent based on your provided architecture diagram and requirements.

Let me break this down systematically:

**1. Agent Description**
The Code Security Analysis Agent (CSAA) is an autonomous system designed to perform comprehensive security analysis of code, acting as a specialized DevSecOps engineer with capabilities in static analysis, dynamic testing, dependency management, and secret scanning. It operates continuously within your development pipeline, providing real-time security insights and remediation guidance.

**2. Agent Core Task/Goal**
Primary objectives:
- Continuous code security assessment across repositories
- Early detection of security vulnerabilities and code smells
- Dependency vulnerability management
- Secrets and sensitive data detection
- Automated security reporting and remediation guidance
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated security gates

**3. Core Agent Integrations**
Based on the architecture diagram:
- Vector Database: For storing and retrieving security patterns and code embeddings
- Knowledge Base: Security best practices, vulnerability patterns, and remediation guides
- Result Cache: For storing analysis results and avoiding redundant scans
- Tool Layer Integration:
  - SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx)
  - DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP)
  - Dependency checkers (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot)
  - Secret scanners (e.g., GitGuardian, TruffleHog)

**4. Core Interactions & Triggers**
Human Interactions:
- Security scan initiation through web interface
- Vulnerability report review and feedback
- Remediation approval workflow
- Custom rule configuration

Automated Triggers:
- Git webhook events (push, pull request)
- Scheduled periodic scans
- CI/CD pipeline stages
- Dependency update events

**5. Input Data/Context**
Static:
- Source code repositories
- Security policy configurations
- Compliance requirements
- Custom security rules
- Known vulnerability patterns

Dynamic:
- Code changes and diffs
- Pull request metadata
- Build context
- Runtime configurations
- Environment variables

**6. Output Data/Context**
Static:
- Security compliance reports
- Vulnerability assessment documents
- Code quality metrics
- Security policy validation results

Dynamic:
- Real-time security alerts
- Interactive vulnerability visualizations
- Remediation suggestions with code examples
- Risk scoring and prioritization
- PR comments and annotations

**7. RAG/Search Components**
- Security knowledge base embeddings
- Code pattern similarity search
- Documentation search for:
  - Security best practices
  - Vulnerability patterns
  - Remediation guides
  - Compliance requirements
  - Tool documentation

**8. Tools/Workflows**
Workflows:
1. Code Commit Analysis
2. Pull Request Security Review
3. Dependency Update Assessment
4. Secret Detection
5. Compliance Validation

Tool APIs:
- Git provider APIs
- CI/CD system APIs
- Security tool APIs
- Issue tracking system APIs
- Monitoring system APIs

**9. LLM Model API Integration**
Primary Use Cases:
- Code analysis and vulnerability detection
- Natural language explanation of security issues
- Remediation suggestion generation
- Security documentation synthesis
- Code fix proposal generation

Model Requirements:
- Code understanding capabilities
- Context window sufficient for code analysis
- Fine-tuning on security patterns
- Capability to generate secure code suggestions
